# Task Warrior Web Wrapper

This is a simple little web server that uses the Task Warrior CLI as a backend.  I primarily made it for myself to learn Task Warrior.  I use the CLI version for work, but wanted to utlize it for around the house jobs and grocery shopping.  This is pretty raw still, and really only an experiment.  But it is light weight and you get all of the power of Task Warrior.  I may expand it using a front end interface like React.
